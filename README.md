# Safe2Moto

First Personally Built App. The App will immediately tell the user the level safety a city currently is while displaying a report below on said city! The safety Label and each aspect of the ride (Weather, Temp., Wind) will be color coded from Green (Safe), Yellow (Uncomfortable), Orange (Risky) and Red (Very Risky).

(Based off my previous Project Moto-Safe, but using diffent techniques to structure the app!)
